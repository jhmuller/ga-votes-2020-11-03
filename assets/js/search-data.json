            "title": "nbdev + GitHub Codespaces: A New Literate Programming Environment",
            "content": "Today, we are going to show you how to set up a literate programming environment, allowing you to use an IDE (VS Code) and an interactive computing environment (Jupyter), without leaving your browser, for free, in under 5 minutes. You’ll even see how VSCode and Jupyter work together automatically! But first, what is literate programming? And how did I go from skeptic to a zealot of literate programming? . Introduction . Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated. According to Knuth, literate programming provides higher-quality programs by forcing programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program. This process makes poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. Knuth also claims that literate programming provides a first-rate documentation system, which is not an add-on, but is grown naturally in the process of exposition of one’s thoughts during a program’s creation. 1 . When I first learned about literate programming, I was quite skeptical. For the longest time, I had wrongly equated Jupyter notebooks with literate programming. Indeed, Jupyter is a brilliant interactive computing system, which was awarded the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award, and is loved by many developers. However, Jupyter falls short of the literate programming paradigm for the following reasons:2 . It can be difficult to compile source code from notebooks. | It can be difficult to diff and use version control with notebooks because they are not stored in plain text. | It is not clear how to automatically generate documentation from notebooks. | It is not clear how to properly run tests suites when writing code in notebooks. | . My skepticism quickly evaporated when I began using nbdev, a project that extends notebooks to complete the literate programming ideal. I spent a month, full time, using nbdev while contributing to the python library fastcore, and can report that Donald Knuth was definitely onto something. The process of writing prose and tests alongside code forced me to deeply understand why the code does what it does, and to think deeply about its design. Furthermore, the reduced cognitive load and speed of iteration of having documentation, code, and tests in one location boosted my productivity to levels I have never before experienced as a software developer. Furthermore, I found that developing this way bolstered collaboration such that code reviews not only happened faster but were more meaningful. In short, nbdev may be the most profound productivity tool I have ever used. . As a teaser, look how easy it is to instantiate this literate programming environment, which includes a notebook, a docs site and an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed! :point_down: . . Features of nbdev . As discussed in the docs, nbdev provides the following features: . Searchable, hyperlinked documentation, which can be automatically hosted on GitHub Pages for free. | Python modules, following best practices such as automatically defining __all__ with your exported functions, classes, and variables. | Pip and Conda installers. | Tests defined directly in notebooks which run in parallel. This testing system has been thoroughly tested with GitHub Actions. | Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and export any changes automatically back into your notebooks. | . Since you are in a notebook, you can also add charts, text, links, images, videos, etc, that are included automatically in the documentation of your library, along with standardized documentation generated automatically from your code. This site is an example of docs generated automatically by nbdev. . GitHub Codespaces . Thanks to Conda and nbdev_template, setting up a development environment with nbdev is far easier than it used to be. However, we realized it could be even easier, thanks to a new GitHub product called Codespaces. Codespaces is a fully functional development environment in your browser, accessible directly from GitHub, that provides the following features: . A full VS Code IDE. | An environment that has files from the repository mounted into the environment, along with your GitHub credentials. | A development environment with dependencies pre-installed, backed by Docker. | The ability to serve additional applications on arbitrary ports. For nbdev, we serve a Jupyter notebook server as well as a Jekyll based documentation site. | A shared file system, which facilitates editing code in one browser tab and rendering the results in another. | … and more. | Codespaces enables developers to immediately participate in a project without wasting time on DevOps or complicated setup steps. Most importantly, CodeSpaces with nbdev allows developers to quickly get started with creating their own software with literate programming. . A demo of nbdev + Codespaces . This demo uses the project fastai/fastcore, which was built with nbdev, as an example. First, we can navigate to this repo and launch a Codespace: . . If you are launching a fresh Codespace, it may take several minutes to set up. Once the environment is ready, we can verify that all dependencies we want are installed (in this case fastcore and nbdev): . . Additionally, we can serve an arbitrary number of applications on user-specified ports, which we can open through VSCode as shown below: . . In this case, these applications are a notebook and docs site. Changes to a notebook are reflected immediately in the data docs. Furthermore, we can use the cli command nbdev_build_lib to sync our notebooks with python modules. This functionality is shown below: . . This is amazing! With a click of a button, I was able to: . Launch an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed. | Launch two additional applications: a Jupyter Notebook server on port 8080 and a docs site on port 4000. | Automatically update the docs and modules every time I make a change to a Jupyter notebook. | This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are additional utilities for writing and executing tests, diffing notebooks, special flags for hiding, showing, and collapsing cells in the generated docs, as well as git hooks for automation. This and more functionality is covered in the nbdev docs. . Give It A Try For Yourself . To try out nbdev yourself, take this tutorial, which will walk you through everything you need to know. The tutorial also shows you how to use a repository template with the configuration files necessary to enable Codespaces with nbdev. . You Can Write Blogs With Notebooks, Too! . This blog post was written in fastpages which is also built on nbdev! We recommend fastpages if you want an easy way to blog with Jupyter notebooks. . Additional Resources . The GitHub Codepaces site. | The official docs for Codespaces. | The nbdev docs. | The nbdev GitHub repo. | fastpages: The project used to write this blog. | The GitHub repo fastai/fastcore, which is what we used in this blog post as an example. | . Wikipedia article: Literate Programming &#8617; . | This is not a criticism of Jupyter. Jupyter doesn’t claim to be a full literate programming system. However, people can sometimes (unfairly) judge Jupyter according to this criteria. &#8617; . |",

            "title": "fastcore: An Underrated Python Library",
            "content": ". Background . I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills: I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques. I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn&#39;t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it. I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find! That&#39;s when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests? I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions. . And that&#39;s exactly what I did over the past month! I&#39;m pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ve discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also why the code works the way it does, and to explore edge cases while writing tests. Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible! It turns out the library I choose, fastcore is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique. . For the uninitiated, fastcore is a library on top of which many fast.ai projects are built on. Most importantly, fastcore extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I&#39;m going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python. My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more! . Why fastcore is interesting . Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python: I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer. From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work. Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell. Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages. | You get a new set of pragmatic tools: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems. | Learn more about the Python programming language: Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process. For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work. | A whirlwind tour through fastcore . Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention. . . Making **kwargs transparent . Whenever I see a function that has the argument **kwargs, I cringe a little. This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, **kwargs)&gt; . Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that foo also accepts and additional parameters b and d. We can fix this with delegates: . def baz(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): return a + b + c @delegates(baz) # this decorator will pass down keyword arguments from baz def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4)&gt; . You can customize the behavior of this decorator. For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping **kwargs: . @delegates(baz, keep=True) def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4, **kwargs)&gt; . You can also exclude arguments. For example, we exclude argument d from delegation: . def basefoo(a, b=2, c =3, d=4): pass @delegates(basefoo, but= [&#39;d&#39;]) # exclude `d` def foo(c, a, **kwargs): pass inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2)&gt; . You can also delegate between classes: . class BaseFoo: def __init__(self, e, c=2): pass @delegates()# since no argument was passsed here we delegate to the superclass class Foo(BaseFoo): def __init__(self, a, b=1, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) inspect.signature(Foo) . &lt;Signature (a, b=1, c=2)&gt; . For more information, read the docs on delegates. . . Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes . Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in __init__? . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b ,c): self.a, self.b, self.c = a, b, c . Ouch! That was painful. Look at all the repeated variable names. Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class? Not Anymore! Checkout store_attr: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr() t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 . You can also exclude certain attributes: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr(but=[&#39;c&#39;]) t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 assert not hasattr(t, &#39;c&#39;) . There are many more ways of customizing and using store_attr than I highlighted here. Check out the docs for more detail. . P.S. you might be thinking that Python dataclasses also allow you to avoid this boilerplate. While true in some cases, store_attr is more flexible.1 . 1. For example, store_attr does not rely on inheritance, which means you won&#39;t get stuck using multiple inheritance when using this with your own classes. Also, unlike dataclasses, store_attr does not require python 3.7 or higher. Furthermore, you can use store_attr anytime in the object lifecycle, and in any location in your class to customize the behavior of how and when variables are stored.↩ . . Avoiding subclassing boilerplate . One thing I hate about python is the __super__().__init__() boilerplate associated with subclassing. For example: . class ParentClass: def __init__(self): self.some_attr = &#39;hello&#39; class ChildClass(ParentClass): def __init__(self): super().__init__() cc = ChildClass() assert cc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; # only accessible b/c you used super . We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass PrePostInitMeta. We define a new class called NewParent that is a wrapper around the ParentClass: . class NewParent(ParentClass, metaclass=PrePostInitMeta): def __pre_init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super().__init__() class ChildClass(NewParent): def __init__(self):pass sc = ChildClass() assert sc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; . . Type Dispatch . Type dispatch, or Multiple dispatch, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives. This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia. For example, this is a conceptual example of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y: . collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting spaceship collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting spaceship . Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks. . Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box. Fortunately, there is the @typedispatch decorator to the rescue. This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function: . @typedispatch def f(x:str, y:str): return f&#39;{x}{y}&#39; @typedispatch def f(x:np.ndarray): return x.sum() @typedispatch def f(x:int, y:int): return x+y . Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function f: . f(&#39;Hello &#39;, &#39;World!&#39;) . &#39;Hello World!&#39; . f(2,3) . 5 . f(np.array([5,5,5,5])) . 20 . There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that you can read about here. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called multipledispatch made by Mathhew Rocklin (the creator of Dask). . After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing. . . A better version of functools.partial . functools.partial is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= val: . test_input = [1,2,3,4,5,6] def f(arr, val): &quot;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&quot; return [x for x in arr if x &gt;= val] f(test_input, 3) . [3, 4, 5, 6] . You can create a new function out of this function using partial that sets the default value to 5: . filter5 = partial(f, val=5) filter5(test_input) . [5, 6] . One problem with partial is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring: . filter5.__doc__ . &#39;partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application n of the given arguments and keywords. n&#39; . fastcore.utils.partialler fixes this, and makes sure the docstring is retained such that the new API is transparent: . filter5 = partialler(f, val=5) filter5.__doc__ . &#39;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&#39; . . Composition of functions . A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result. This is especially useful when applying various data transformations. Consider a toy example where I have three functions: (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers: . def add(arr, val): return [x + val for x in arr] def arrsum(arr): return sum(arr) # See the previous section on partialler add2 = partialler(add, val=2) transform = compose(filter5, add2, arrsum) transform([1,2,3,4,5,6]) . 15 . But why is this useful? You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with: . arrsum(add2(filter5([1,2,3,4,5,6]))) . You are not wrong! However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following: . def fit(x, transforms:list): &quot;fit a model after performing transformations&quot; x = compose(*transforms)(x) y = [np.mean(x)] * len(x) # its a dumb model. Don&#39;t judge me return y # filters out elements &lt; 5, adds 2, then predicts the mean fit(x=[1,2,3,4,5,6], transforms=[filter5, add2]) . [7.5, 7.5] . For more information about compose, read the docs. . . A more useful __repr__ . In python, __repr__ helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging. Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using store_attr, which was discussed earlier). . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() # `store_attr` was discussed previously Test(1) . &lt;__main__.Test at 0x7ffcd766cee0&gt; . We can use basic_repr to quickly give us a more sensible default: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() __repr__ = basic_repr(&#39;a,b,c&#39;) Test(2) . Test(a=2, b=2, c=3) . . Monkey Patching With A Decorator . It can be convenient to monkey patch with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing. We can use the decorator @patch from fastcore.foundation along with type hints like so: . class MyClass(int): pass @patch def func(self:MyClass, a): return self+a mc = MyClass(3) . Now, MyClass has an additional method named func: . mc.func(10) . 13 . Still not convinced? I&#39;ll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section. . . A better pathlib.Path . When you see these extensions to pathlib.path you won&#39;t ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as: . Path.readlines: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.readlines() | Path.read: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.read() | Path.save: saves file as pickle | Path.load: loads pickle file | Path.ls: shows the contents of the path as a list. | etc. | . Read more about this here. Here is a demonstration of ls: . from fastcore.utils import * from pathlib import Path p = Path(&#39;.&#39;) p.ls() # you don&#39;t get this with vanilla Pathlib.Path!! . (#7) [Path(&#39;2020-09-01-fastcore.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;README.md&#39;),Path(&#39;fastcore_imgs&#39;),Path(&#39;2020-02-20-test.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;.ipynb_checkpoints&#39;),Path(&#39;2020-02-21-introducing-fastpages.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;my_icons&#39;)] . Wait! What&#39;s going on here? We just imported pathlib.Path - why are we getting this new functionality? Thats because we imported the fastcore.utils module, which patches this module via the @patch decorator discussed earlier. Just to drive the point home on why the @patch decorator is useful, I&#39;ll go ahead and add another method to Path right now: . @patch def fun(self:Path): return &quot;This is fun!&quot; p.fun() . &#39;This is fun!&#39; . That is magical, right? I know! That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing about it! . . An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas . Self, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object. For example, let&#39;s create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array: . arr=np.array([5,4,3,2,1]) f = lambda a: a.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . You can use Self in the same way: . f = Self.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . Let&#39;s create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe: . import pandas as pd df=pd.DataFrame({&#39;Some Column&#39;: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, ], &#39;Another Column&#39;: [5, 7, 50, 70]}) f = Self.groupby(&#39;Some Column&#39;).mean() f(df) . Another Column . Some Column . a 6 | . b 60 | . Read more about Self in the docs). . . Notebook Functions . These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell: . from fastcore.imports import in_notebook, in_colab, in_ipython in_notebook(), in_colab(), in_ipython() . (True, False, True) . This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment. . . A Drop-In Replacement For List . You might be pretty happy with Python&#39;s list. This is one of those situations that you don&#39;t know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you. Enter L, a list like object with many extra goodies. . The best way I can describe L is to pretend that list and numpy had a pretty baby: . define a list (check out the nice __repr__ that shows the length of the list!) . L(1,2,3) . (#3) [1,2,3] . Shuffle a list: . p = L.range(20).shuffle() p . (#20) [8,7,5,12,14,16,2,15,19,6...] . Index into a list: . p[2,4,6] . (#3) [5,14,2] . L has sensible defaults, for example appending an element to a list: . 1 + L(2,3,4) . (#4) [1,2,3,4] . There is much more L has to offer. Read the docs to learn more. . But Wait ... There&#39;s More! . There are more things I would like to show you about fastcore, but there is no way they would reasonably fit into a blog post. Here is a list of some of my favorite things that I didn&#39;t demo in this blog post: . Utilities . The Basics section contain many shortcuts to perform common tasks or provide an additional interface to what standard python provides. . mk_class: quickly add a bunch of attributes to a class | wrap_class: add new methods to a class with a simple decorator | groupby: similar to Scala&#39;s groupby | merge: merge dicts | fasttuple: a tuple on steroids | Infinite Lists: useful for padding and testing | chunked: for batching and organizing stuff | . Multiprocessing . The Multiprocessing section extends python&#39;s multiprocessing library by offering features like: . progress bars | ability to pause to mitigate race conditions with external services | processing things in batches on each worker, ex: if you have a vectorized operation to perform in chunks | . Functional Programming . The functional programming section is my favorite part of this library. . maps: a map that also composes functions | mapped: A more robust map | using_attr: compose a function that operates on an attribute | . Transforms . Transforms is a collection of utilities for creating data transformations and associated pipelines. These transformation utilities build upon many of the building blocks discussed in this blog post. . Further Reading . It should be noted that you should read the main page of the docs first, followed by the section on tests to fully understand the documentation. . The fastcore documentation site. | The fastcore GitHub repo. | Blog post on delegation. | . Shameless plug: fastpages . This blog post was written entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, which GitHub automatically converted into to a blog post! Sound interesting? Check out fastpages. .",

            "content": "What Superpowers? . Hi, I’m Hamel Husain. I’m a machine learning engineer at GitHub. Recently, GitHub released a new product called GitHub Actions, which has mostly flown under the radar in the machine learning and data science community as just another continuous integration tool. . Recently, I’ve been able to use GitHub Actions to build some very unique tools for Data Scientists, which I want to share with you today. Most importantly, I hope to get you excited about GitHub Actions, and the promise it has for giving you new superpowers as a Data Scientist. Here are two projects I recently built with Actions that show off its potential: . fastpages . fastpages is an automated, open-source blogging platform with enhanced support for Jupyter notebooks. You save your notebooks, markdown, or Word docs into a directory on GitHub, and they automatically become blog posts. Read the announcement below: . We&#39;re launching `fastpages`, a platform which allows you to host a blog for free, with no ads. You can blog with @ProjectJupyter notebooks, @office Word, directly from @github&#39;s markdown editor, etc.Nothing to install, &amp; setup is automated!https://t.co/dNSA0oQUrN . &mdash; Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward) February 24, 2020 Machine Learning Ops . Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invoke a chatbot natively on GitHub to test your machine learning models on the infrastructure of your choice (GPUs), log all the results, and give you a rich report back in a pull request so that everyone could see the results? You can with GitHub Actions! . Consider the below annotated screenshot of this Pull Request: . . A more in-depth explanation about the above project can be viewed in this video: . Using GitHub Actions for machine learning workflows is starting to catch on. Julien Chaumond, CTO of Hugging Face, says: . GitHub Actions are great because they let us do CI on GPUs (as most of our users use the library on GPUs not on CPUs), on our own infra! 1 . Additionally, you can host a GitHub Action for other people so others can use parts of your workflow without having to re-create your steps. I provide examples of this below. . A Gentle Introduction To GitHub Actions . What Are GitHub Actions? . GitHub Actions allow you to run arbitrary code in response to events. Events are activities that happen on GitHub such as: . Opening a pull request | Making an issue comment | Labeling an issue | Creating a new branch | … and many more | . When an event is created, the GitHub Actions context is hydrated with a payload containing metadata for that event. Below is an example of a payload that is received when an issue is created: . { &quot;action&quot;: &quot;created&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: 444500041, &quot;number&quot;: 1, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spelling error in the README file&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: { &quot;login&quot;: &quot;Codertocat&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;User&quot;, }, &quot;labels&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: 1362934389, &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;MDU6TGFiZWwxMzYyOTM0Mzg5&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bug&quot;, } ], &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It looks like you accidently spelled &#39;commit&#39; with two &#39;t&#39;s.&quot; } . This functionality allows you to respond to various events on GitHub in an automated way. In addition to this payload, GitHub Actions also provide a plethora of variables and environment variables that afford easy to access metadata such as the username and the owner of the repo. Additionally, other people can package useful functionality into an Action that other people can inherit. For example, consider the below Action that helps you publish python packages to PyPi: . The Usage section describes how this Action can be used: . - name: Publish a Python distribution to PyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master with: user: __token__ password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }} . This Action expects two inputs: user and a password. You will notice that the password is referencing a variable called secrets, which is a variable that contains an encrypted secret that you can upload to your GitHub repository. There are thousands of Actions (that are free) for a wide variety of tasks that can be discovered on the GitHub Marketplace. The ability to inherit ready-made Actions in your workflow allows you to accomplish complex tasks without implementing all of the logic yourself. Some useful Actions for those getting started are: . actions/checkout: Allows you to quickly clone the contents of your repository into your environment, which you often want to do. This does a number of other things such as automatically mount your repository’s files into downstream Docker containers. | mxschmitt/action-tmate: Proivdes a way to debug Actions interactively. This uses port forwarding to give you a terminal in the browser that is connected to your Actions runner. Be careful not to expose sensitive information if you use this. | actions/github-script: Gives you a pre-authenticated ocotokit.js client that allows you to interact with the GitHub API to accomplish almost any task on GitHub automatically. Only these endpoints are supported (for example, the secrets endpoint is not in that list). | . In addition to the aforementioned Actions, it is helpful to go peruse the official GitHub Actions docs before diving in. . Example: A fastpages Action Workflow . The best to way familiarize yourself with Actions is by studying examples. Let’s take a look at the Action workflow that automates the build of fastpages (the platform used to write this blog post). . Part 1: Define Workflow Triggers . First, we define triggers in ci.yaml. Like all Actions workflows, this is a YAML file located in the .github/workflows directory of the GitHub repo. . The top of this YAML file looks like this: . name: CI on: push: branches: - master pull_request: . This means that this workflow is triggered on either a push or pull request event. Furthermore, push events are filtered such that only pushes to the master branch will trigger the workflow, whereas all pull requests will trigger this workflow. It is important to note that pull requests opened from forks will have read-only access to the base repository and cannot access any secrets for security reasons. The reason for defining the workflow in this way is we wanted to trigger the same workflow to test pull requests as well as build and deploy the website when a PR is merged into master. This will be clarified as we step through the rest of the YAML file. . Part 2: Define Jobs . Next, we define jobs (there is only one in this workflow). Per the docs: . A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. . jobs: build-site: if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: . The keyword build-site is the name of your job and you can name it whatever you want. In this case, we have a conditional if statement that dictates if this job should be run or not. We are trying to ensure that this workflow does not run when the first commit to a repo is made with the message ‘Initial commit’. The first variable in the if statement, github.event, contains a json payload of the event that triggered this workflow. When developing workflows, it is helpful to print this variable in order to inspect its structure, which you can accomplish with the following YAML: . - name: see payload run: | echo &quot;PAYLOAD: n${PAYLOAD} n&quot; env: PAYLOAD: ${{ toJSON(github.event) }} . Note: the above step is only for debugging and is not currently in the workflow. . toJson is a handy function that returns a pretty-printed JSON representation of the variable. The output is printed directly in the logs contained in the Actions tab of your repo. In this example, printing the payload for a push event will look like this (truncated for brevity): . { &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;refs/tags/simple-tag&quot;, &quot;before&quot;: &quot;6113728f27ae8c7b1a77c8d03f9ed6e0adf246&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: false, &quot;deleted&quot;: true, &quot;forced&quot;: false, &quot;base_ref&quot;: null, &quot;commits&quot;: [ { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;updated README.md&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;hamelsmu&quot; }, ], &quot;head_commit&quot;: null, } . Therefore, the variable github.event.commits[0].message will retrieve the first commit message in the array of commits. Since we are looking for situations where there is only one commit, this logic suffices. The second variable in the if statement, github.run_number is a special variable in Actions which: . [is a] unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow’s first run, and increments with each new run. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run. . Therefore, the if statement introduced above: . if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 . Allows the workflow to run when the commit message is “Initial commit” as long as it is not the first commit. ( || is a logical or operator). . Finally, the line runs-on: ubuntu-latest specifies the host operating system that your workflows will run in. . Part 3: Define Steps . Per the docs: . A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an Action in your repository, a public repository, or an Action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run Actions, but all Actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job. . Below are the first two steps in our workflow: . - name: Copy Repository Contents uses: actions/checkout@master with: persist-credentials: false - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts uses: ./_action_files . The first step creates a copy of your repository in the Actions file system, with the help of the utility action/checkout. This utility only fetches the last commit by default and saves files into a directory (whose path is stored in the environment variable GITHUB_WORKSPACE that is accessible by subsequent steps in your job. The second step runs the fastai/fastpages Action, which converts notebooks and word documents to blog posts automatically. In this case, the syntax: . uses: ./_action_files . is a special case where the pre-made GitHub Action we want to run happens to be defined in the same repo that runs this workflow. This syntax allows us to test changes to this pre-made Action when evaluating PRs by referencing the directory in the current repository that defines that pre-made Action. Note: Building pre-made Actions is beyond the scope of this tutorial. . The next three steps in our workflow are defined below: . - name: setup directories for Jekyll build run: | rm -rf _site sudo chmod -R 777 . - name: Jekyll build uses: docker://fastai/fastpages-jekyll with: args: bash -c &quot;gem install bundler &amp;&amp; jekyll build -V&quot; env: JEKYLL_ENV: &#39;production&#39; - name: copy CNAME file into _site if CNAME exists run: | sudo chmod -R 777 _site/ cp CNAME _site/ 2&gt;/dev/null || : . The step named setup directories for Jekyll build executes shell commands that remove the _site folder in order to get rid of stale files related to the page we want to build, as well as grant permissions to all the files in our repo to subsequent steps. . The step named Jekyll build executes a docker container hosted by the Jekyll community on Dockerhub called jekyll/jekyll. For those not familiar with Docker, see this tutorial. The name of this container is called fastai/fastpages-jekyll because I’m adding some additional dependencies to jekyll/jekyll and hosting those on my DockerHub account for faster build times2. The args parameter allows you to execute arbitrary commands with the Docker container by overriding the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile. We use this Docker container hosted on Dockerhub so we don’t have to deal with installing and configuring all of the complicated dependencies for Jekyll. The files from our repo are already available in the Actions runtime due to the first step in this workflow, and are mounted into this Docker container automatically for us. In this case, we are running the command jekyll build, which builds our website and places relevant assets them into the _site folder. For more information about Jekyll, read the official docs. Finally, the env parameter allows me to pass an environment variable into the Docker container. . The final command above copies a CNAME file into the _site folder, which we need for the custom domain https://fastpages.fast.ai. Setting up custom domains are outside the scope of this article. . The final step in our workflow is defined below: . - name: Deploy if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./_site . The statement . if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; . uses the variable github.event_name to ensure this step only runs when a push event ( in this case only pushes to the master branch trigger this workflow) occur. . This step deploys the fastpages website by copying the contents of the _site folder to the root of the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses for hosting. This step uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages Action, pinned at version 3. Their README describes various options and inputs for this Action. . Conclusion . We hope that this has shed some light on how we use GitHub Actions to automate fastpages. While we only covered one workflow above, we hope this provides enough intuition to understand the other workflows in fastpages. We have only scratched the surface of GitHub Actions in this blog post, but we provide other materials below for those who want to dive in deeper. We have not covered how to host an Action for other people, but you can start with these docs to learn more. . Still confused about how GitHub Actions could be used for Data Science?

            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

            "content": "When writing a blog post with Microsoft Word – the filename becomes the title. In this case the file name is “2020-01-01-Microsoft-Word-Example-Post.docx”. . There is minimal support for Word documents in fastpages compared to Jupyter notebooks. Some known limitations: . alt text in Word documents are not yet supported by fastpages, and will break links to images. . | You can only specify front matter for Word documents globally. See the README for more details. . | . For greater control over the content produced from Word documents, you will need to convert Word to markdown files manually. You can follow the steps in this blog post, which walk you through how to use pandoc to do the conversion. Note: If you wish to customize your Word generated blog post in markdown, make sure you delete your Word document from the _word directory so your markdown file doesn’t get overwritten! . If your primary method of writing blog posts is Word documents, and you plan on always manually editing Word generated markdown files, you are probably better off using fast_template instead of fastpages. . The material below is a reproduction of this blog post, and serves as an illustrative example. . Maintaining a healthy open source project can entail a huge amount of toil. Popular projects often have orders of magnitude more users and episodic contributors opening issues and PRs than core maintainers capable of handling these issues. . Consider this graphic prepared by the NumFOCUS foundation showing the number of maintainers for three widely used scientific computing projects: . . We can see that across these three projects, there is a very low ratio maintainers to users. Fixing this problem is not an easy task and likely requires innovative solutions to address the economics as well as tools. . Due to its recent momentum and popularity, Kubeflow suffers from a similar fate as illustrated by the growth of new issues opened: . . Source: “TensorFlow World 2019, Automating Your Developer Workflow With ML” . Coincidentally, while building out end to end machine learning examples for Kubeflow, we built two examples using publicly available GitHub data: GitHub Issue Summarization and Code Search. While these tutorials were useful for demonstrating components of Kubeflow, we realized that we could take this a step further and build concrete data products that reduce toil for maintainers. . This is why we started the project kubeflow/code-intelligence, with the goals of increasing project velocity and health using data driven tools. Below are two projects we are currently experimenting with : . Issue Label Bot: This is a bot that automatically labels GitHub issues using Machine Learning. This bot is a GitHub App that was originally built for Kubeflow but is now also used by several large open source projects. The current version of this bot only applies a very limited set of labels, however we are currently A/B testing new models that allow personalized labels. Here is a blog post discussing this project in more detail. . | Issue Triage GitHub Action: to compliment the Issue Label Bot, we created a GitHub Action that automatically adds / removes Issues to the Kubeflow project board tracking issues needing triage. . | Together these projects allow us to reduce the toil of triaging issues. The GitHub Action makes it much easier for the Kubeflow maintainers to track issues needing triage. With the label bot we have taken the first steps in using ML to replace human intervention. We plan on using features extracted by ML to automate more steps in the triage process to further reduce toil. . Building Solutions with GitHub Actions . One of the premises of Kubeflow is that a barrier to building data driven, ML powered solutions is getting models into production and integrated into a solution. In the case of building models to improve OSS project health, that often means integrating with GitHub where the project is hosted. . We are really excited by GitHub’s newly released feature GitHub Actions because we think it will make integrating ML with GitHub much easier. . For simple scripts, like the issue triage script, GitHub actions make it easy to automate executing the script in response to GitHub events without having to build and host a GitHub app. . To automate adding/removing issues needing triage to a Kanban board we wrote a simple python script that interfaces with GitHub’s GraphQL API to modify issues. . As we continue to iterate on ML Models to further reduce toil, GitHub Actions will make it easy to leverage Kubeflow to put our models into production faster. A number of prebuilt GitHub Actions make it easy to create Kubernetes resources in response to GitHub events. For example, we have created GitHub Actions to launch Argo Workflows. This means once we have a Kubernetes job or workflow to perform inference we can easily integrate the model with GitHub and have the full power of Kubeflow and Kubernetes (eg. GPUs). We expect this will allow us to iterate much faster compared to building and maintaining GitHub Apps. . Call To Action . We have a lot more work to do in order to achieve our goal of reducing the amount of toil involved in maintaining OSS projects. If your interested in helping out here’s a couple of issues to get started: . Help us create reports that pull and visualize key performance indicators (KPI). https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/71 . We have defined our KPI here: issue #19 | . | Combine repo specific and non-repo specific label predictions: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/70 . | . In addition to the aforementioned issues we welcome contributions for these other issues in our repo. .",
